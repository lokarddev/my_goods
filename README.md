# My goods
Simple shopping list app. My API World 2021 project.

# Inspiration
The main goal of this simple web app is to make your daily 
shopping easy and enjoyable.

# What it does
The application allows you to customize your own shopping lists based on 
dishes generated from products. Each item of the dish includes the quantity 
of the product. The user composes dishes from predefined products, or 
contributes his own. Then, he adds the desired dishes to the shopping 
list. Once the list is complete, the user can start shopping. 
At the push of a button, all the dishes from the list are scattered 
into the products necessary for purchase, in their exact quantity

# What's next for My goods
Scaling to more customizable features, like predeclared lists or diets with 
calorie counting.
